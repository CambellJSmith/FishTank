 Fishtank Game code

This is the code and assets for my game "FishTank"
Feel free to use it. Beware that the art was all taken from various GBA games. i know, naughty me. This is an entirely non-profit excersise. i just really enjoy programming and have no pixel art skills.
Please enjoy, do whatever you want with the code. I'd appreciate attribution but it's not nessecary.
You can find a live version of thi game on here. https://simmer.io/@CambellJsmith/fishtank
