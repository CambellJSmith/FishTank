 Fishtank Game code

This is the code and assets for my game "FishTank"
Feel free to use it. Beware that the art was all taken from various GBA games. i know, naughty me. This is an entirely non-profit excersise. i just really enjoy programming and have no pixel art skills.

Please enjoy, do whatever you want with the code. I'd appreciate attribution but it's not nessecary.

the files contain no 'Library' foleder due to size constraints but that doesn't matter. The first time opening the project will just take a little bit longer to generate a new 'Library' folder for you.
You can find a live version of thi game on here. https://simmer.io/@CambellJsmith/fishtank
